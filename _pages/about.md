I received both my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Central South University. During my studies, my research focused on developing algorithms and optimization methods to address high-performance gear design and manufacturing challenges.

Currently, I am actively seeking a PhD position or a research assistant role with potential for a PhD. My research interest includes computational design, smart manufacturing, or advanced technologies in design and manufacturing like computer vision, VR, or human-robot collaboration. I am also open to discussing new research topics.
