<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received both my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Central South University. During my studies, my research focused on developing algorithms and optimization methods to address gear design and manufacturing challenges. I have a solid research foundation, strong coding skills, and proficiency in machine operation. 

Currently, I am actively seeking a PhD position or a research assistant role with potential for a PhD. My research interest includes computational design, smart manufacturing, or advanced technologies in design and manufacturing like computer vision, VR, or human-robot collaboration.
